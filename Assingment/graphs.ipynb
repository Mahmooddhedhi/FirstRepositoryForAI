    "\n",
    "  * Overview of Proportions: Pie charts are ideal for visualizing how individual components contribute to the whole and understanding the relative proportions or percentages of different categories.\n",
    "  * Simple and Intuitive: Pie charts are easy to understand and interpret, making them accessible to a wide range of audiences, including those with limited data literacy.\n",
    "  * Emphasizing Relative Sizes: The area of each sector in a pie chart visually emphasizes the differences in proportion between categories. Larger sectors indicate a larger share of the whole.\n",
    "  * Limited Categories: Pie charts are best suited for displaying data with a limited number of categories, typically up to around seven. Too many categories can make the chart cluttered and difficult to interpret.\n",
    "  * Easy Comparison: It's relatively easy to compare the sizes of different categories in a pie chart, allowing for quick identification of the largest and smallest segments.\n",
    "  * Highlighting a Single Variable: Pie charts are primarily used to highlight the distribution or composition of a single variable rather than comparing multiple variables or showing trends over time.\n",
    "  * Visual Appeal: The circular shape of a pie chart is visually appealing and can draw attention to the data, making it a popular choice for presentations and reports.\n",
    "  * Limitations: Pie charts have some limitations. They may not be suitable for showing precise values, and it can be challenging to accurately compare the sizes of small sectors or those with similar values.\n",
    "  * Data Labels and Legends: Including data labels or a legend is important to provide context and clearly identify each category in the pie chart.\n",
    "  * Context and Interpretation: Pie charts should always be accompanied by appropriate context and explanations to ensure viewers understand the significance of the data and the story it conveys.\n",

    "  * Relationship Exploration: Scatter plots are used to explore and understand the relationship between two continuous variables, such as age and income, height and weight, or temperature and sales.\n",
    "  * Pattern Identification: By visualizing data points as dots, scatter plots help identify patterns, trends, clusters, or outliers within the dataset.\n",
    "  * Correlation Assessment: Scatter plots can reveal the presence and strength of correlation between two variables. A positive correlation indicates that as one variable increases, the other also tends to increase, while a negative correlation indicates an inverse relationship.\n",
    "  * Outlier Detection: Scatter plots make it easier to spot outliers—individual data points that deviate significantly from the general trend—and investigate their potential causes or impacts.\n",
    "  * Data Clustering: By observing the clustering or dispersion of data points, scatter plots can indicate whether there are distinct groups or clusters within the dataset.\n",
    "  * Visualizing Distributions: Scatter plots provide a visual representation of the distribution of data points along each axis, offering insights into their range, concentration, and spread.\n",
    "  * Variable Comparison: Scatter plots allow for a direct comparison between two variables, showing their individual distributions and the joint distribution.\n",
    "  * Identifying Relationships: Scatter plots can help determine the nature of the relationship between variables, such as linear, quadratic, exponential, or no discernible relationship.\n",
    "  * Data Transformation: Scatter plots can aid in deciding whether data transformation, such as logarithmic scaling, is necessary to better understand the relationship between variables.\n",
